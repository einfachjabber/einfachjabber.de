Information on this piece of software
-------------------------------------

### Purpose
The application was to show dead-easy step-by-step tutorials, to get more people to use jabber as their primary instant messaging platform.
Ok, tutorials could just have been written into static HTML-files, or presented through a wiki engine. There are several downsides on these kinds of approaches, the worst one being the immense investment of time you have to put into maintaining the tutorials spread over a lot of HTML-files or wiki pages.
This approach uses a single JSON-formatted file together with a folder of screenshots per tutorial. This makes the tutorials easy to update if a new version of the software appears.

### Basics
The original version was based on the python WSGI-framework [Werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org "Werkzeug") and used [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/ "Jinja2") as its templating engine. To be correct it still does, but is now powered by [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org "Flask"), which is considered to be a micro-framework, but the effort of the extentioneers and the awesome documentation really make it a pleasure to work with.
Currently it depends on JSON as storage for the tutorial information like the image names and the text to display underneath. The tutorials are kept in a separate git-repository, which you can find [here](http://github.com/zeroathome/jabber-tutorials "jabber-tutorials on github").
